# Load Distrix

Load Distrix is a simple HTTP load balancer written in Go. It distributes incoming HTTP requests across multiple backend servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. The load balancer uses a round-robin algorithm to cycle through the available backend servers, automatically retrying requests on failure and marking unresponsive servers as down.

## Features

- **Round-Robin Load Balancing:** Distributes requests evenly across backend servers.
- **Health Checks:** Continuously monitors the status of backend servers.
- **Automatic Retry:** Retries requests up to three times in case of failure.
- **Dynamic Server Pool:** Automatically adjusts to backend server availability.

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or higher
- A configured JSON file named `LoadDistrix.config.json` with backend server details.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/muruga21/LoadDistrix.git
   cd loaddistrix
   ```

2. Prepare the configuration file:

   write loadbalancer config file in the root directory with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "backend": [
       {
         "host": "server1",
         "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
       },
       {
         "host": "server2",
         "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8082"
       }
     ]
     ...continue with your backend configuration
   }
   ```

   ```toml
   [backend]
   host="server1"
   url="http://127.0.0.1:8081"
   [backend]
   host="server2"
   url="http://127.0.0.1:8082"

   ... continue with your backend configuration
   ```

   ```yaml
   backend:
    - host: "server1"
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
    - host: "server2"
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8082"

  ...continue with your backend configuration

```

3. Build and run the load balancer:

```sh
go build -o loaddistrix main.go
./loaddistrix <config-file>
````

4. The load balancer will start on port 8000. You can now send HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8000`, and they will be distributed across your configured backend servers.

## Configuration

To configure loadbalancer, write a configuration file with your choice of file extension. Each backend server should be specified with its `host` and `url`.

Example:

```json
{
  "backend": [
    {
      "host": "server1",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
    },
    {
      "host": "server2",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8082"
    }
  ]
  ...continue with your backend configuration
}
```

```toml
[backend]
host="server1"
url="http://127.0.0.1:8081"
[backend]
host="server2"
url="http://127.0.0.1:8082"

... continue with your backend configuration
```

```yaml
 backend:
- host: "server1"
 url: "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
- host: "server2"
 url: "http://127.0.0.1:8082"

 ...continue with your backend configuration
```
